  description: [
    "Sigiriya, also known as The Lion Rock, is one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic landmarks. This ancient rock fortress is located in the Cultural Triangle and stands majestically above the surrounding jungles. Built during the reign of King Kashyapa in the 5th century, the site is both historically significant and visually breathtaking.",
    "The climb to the top takes about 45–60 minutes, passing through beautifully landscaped water gardens, impressive rock shelters, and the world-famous Sigiriya frescoes. Midway up the rock, you'll encounter the grand Lion’s Gate with massive carved paws that signal the beginning of the final ascent.",
    "At the summit, visitors are rewarded with the remains of the king’s ancient palace and an incredible 360-degree view of forests, lakes, and distant mountains. Sigiriya is a perfect combination of history, architecture, and natural beauty — a must-visit destination for every traveler.",
