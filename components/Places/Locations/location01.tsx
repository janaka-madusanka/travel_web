  description: [
    "Pidurangala Rock is located just a short distance from the world-famous Sigiriya Rock Fortress. It's a popular spot for both sunrise and sunset, offering breathtaking 360-degree views of the surrounding landscape. The climb is an adventurous alternative to its more crowded neighbor.",
    "The journey to the top takes about 30-45 minutes. Along the way, you'll pass a small temple and a large reclining Buddha statue. The final ascent involves navigating through and around large boulders, adding to the excitement.",
    "Once at the summit, the vast, open rock surface provides an unparalleled panoramic view. It's the perfect spot for photographers and nature lovers. Watching the sunrise from here as it illuminates the jungle is unforgettable.",
