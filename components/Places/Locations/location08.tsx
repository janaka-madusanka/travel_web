    "Polonnaruwa was the second capital of Sri Lanka after the destruction of Anuradhapura in 993. It comprises, besides the Brahmanic monuments built by the Cholas, the monumental ruins of the fabulous garden-city created by Parakramabahu I in the 12th century.",
    "The Ancient City of Polonnaruwa has been declared a World Heritage Site. The city is one of the best planned archeological relic sites in the country, standing testimony to the discipline and greatness of the Kingdom's first rulers.",
    "The city is also known for its population of Toque Macaques. The monkeys have been living in the ruins since human occupation and continued to thrive there long after humans left.",
